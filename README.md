# San Diego Region COAWST model 

Code adapted from the pathogen hindcast/forecast model, originally written by Matt Spydell: github.com/mspydell/PFM
This code is meant to run model on the Giddings lab "Estuaries" server. 

## Initial Directory Format 
The nested level directories need to have the correct file structure in order to use the PHM model code. You can build this directory using dirsetup.py. Edit the code to input the correct root directories.
